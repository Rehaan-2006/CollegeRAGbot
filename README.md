# CollegeRAGbot
A fully local Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built to answer questions about a college using data scraped from its website. It combines Crawl4AI for data extraction, ChromaDB for vector search, PydanticAI for agent orchestration, Ollama for the local LLM, and Streamlit for the UI.
